# Session Log

> Chronological record of each build session.

## Session 0 — System Setup (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Explored all reference projects (khairold-com, quotecraft, three-anchors, caselaw, unifi-com-my, second-brain, webm-converter)
- Read all 8 systems articles (plan-protocol, agent-soul, work-on-the-system, autopilot, self-aware-agents, atomic-design, browser-tool, meta-tasks)
- Analyzed T3 Code and Electrobun reference repos
- Reviewed existing pibun documentation (6 doc files)
- Created full agent operating system:
  - `.plan/` — PLAN.md (8 phases, 100+ items), MEMORY.md (15 decisions), DRIFT.md, SESSION-LOG.md
  - `.pi/` — AGENTS.md (5 roles, gap detection, 4 playbooks), CAPABILITY-MAP.md
  - `.agents/` — SOUL.md, HUMAN.md, TENSIONS.md, CONVENTIONS.md
  - `CLAUDE.md` — session boot file

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.7 — Set up agent system

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Next:** Phase 0 items 0.8–0.18 — Initialize Bun monorepo scaffold
- Start with 0.8 (workspace root package.json)
- Need to verify `pi --mode rpc` works (0.18) — requires Pi installed locally with API keys
- All docs already written — the scaffold should follow ARCHITECTURE.md structure exactly
- Reference `reference/t3code/package.json` and `reference/t3code/turbo.json` for monorepo patterns

---

## Session 1 — Root Config Scaffolding (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created root `package.json` with Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), scripts for build/dev/typecheck/lint/format
- Created `turbo.json` with build/dev/typecheck/clean tasks (lint runs via Biome at root, not via Turbo)
- Created `tsconfig.base.json` with strict TypeScript settings matching t3code patterns (ES2023, Bundler resolution, verbatimModuleSyntax, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- Created `biome.json` with tabs, double quotes, semicolons, recommended lint rules, noUnusedImports/noUnusedVariables warnings
- Installed deps: Turbo 2.8.20, Biome 1.9.4, TypeScript 5.9.3
- Fixed: Turbo 2.8+ requires `packageManager` field — added `"packageManager": "bun@1.2.21"`
- Fixed: Biome postinstall blocked — ran `bun pm trust @biomejs/biome`
- Formatted all files with Biome (spaces → tabs)
- Verified `bun run typecheck && bun run lint` passes

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.8 — Initialize Bun workspace root
- [x] 0.9 — Set up Turbo for build orchestration
- [x] 0.10 — Set up base TypeScript config
- [x] 0.11 — Set up Biome for lint + format

**Issues encountered:**
- Turbo 2.8+ requires `packageManager` in root package.json (not documented in t3code reference which uses an older Turbo)
- Biome postinstall needs explicit trust in Bun

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 0.12 — Create `packages/contracts/` scaffold
- Items 0.12–0.16 are package/app scaffolds (each small — could combine several)
- All config files use tabs (Biome formatter). Run `bun run format` after writing new files
- tsconfig.base.json does NOT include Bun types — server package must add `@types/bun` itself
- tsconfig.base.json does NOT include JSX config — web package must add `jsx: "react-jsx"` itself

---

## Session 2 — Package Scaffolds + RPC Verification (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created all 5 package/app scaffolds (0.12–0.16):
  - `packages/contracts/` — types-only package, empty `src/index.ts`
  - `packages/shared/` — runtime utils with subpath export `./jsonl`, depends on contracts
  - `apps/server/` — Bun server with `@types/bun`, depends on contracts + shared
  - `apps/web/` — React 19 + Vite 6 + Tailwind v4, with `@/` path alias, `index.html`, stub App component
  - `apps/desktop/` — Electrobun placeholder with `@types/bun`, depends on contracts
- Ran `bun install` — 90 packages installed, trusted `esbuild` postinstall
- Fixed Biome import ordering in `vite.config.ts` (`node:` builtins must come first)
- Verified `bun run typecheck` passes (all 5 packages)
- Verified `bun run lint` passes (22 files, no issues)
- Verified Pi RPC mode with Pi 0.61.1:
  - `get_available_models` returns 23 Anthropic models
  - `get_state` returns model info, session details, streaming status
  - Discovered: commands use `"type"` field (not `"command"`), Pi auto-creates sessions

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.12 — Create `packages/contracts/` scaffold
- [x] 0.13 — Create `packages/shared/` scaffold
- [x] 0.14 — Create `apps/server/` scaffold
- [x] 0.15 — Create `apps/web/` scaffold
- [x] 0.16 — Create `apps/desktop/` scaffold
- [x] 0.17 — Verify monorepo: `bun install` + `bun run typecheck` + `bun run lint` all pass
- [x] 0.18 — Verify Pi RPC works locally

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome organizeImports requires `node:` builtins before `@scoped` packages — fixed immediately
- esbuild (Vite dep) needs `bun pm trust` — already in trustedDependencies from Session 1

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Phase 0 is COMPLETE** — all exit criteria met
- Next: Phase 1A.1 — Define Pi RPC event types in `packages/contracts/`
- Read `reference/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` for authoritative event type definitions
- Key: Pi RPC commands use `{"type": "command_name"}` format, responses use `{"type": "response", "command": "..."}`
- All source files are stubs — real implementation starts in Phase 1A

---

## Session 4 — JSONL Parser + Tests (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `JsonlParser` class in `packages/shared/src/jsonl.ts`:
  - Stateful buffer accumulation, strict LF-only splitting, optional `\r` stripping
  - `feed(chunk)` — processes data, emits complete lines via callback
  - `flush()` — emits any remaining buffered content (for stream end)
  - `reset()` — discards buffered content
  - `serializeJsonl(value)` — serializes a value as `JSON + \n` for writing to Pi stdin
  - Pattern follows Pi's own `attachJsonlLineReader` but is framework-agnostic (not tied to Node `Readable`)
- Wrote 34 unit tests in `packages/shared/src/jsonl.test.ts` covering:
  - Basic parsing (single line, multiple lines, valid JSON)
  - Partial lines (split across 2-3 chunks, many small chunks)
  - Unicode line separators (U+2028, U+2029 preserved inside JSON strings)
  - Empty lines (skipped between records, leading, trailing)
  - Rapid multi-line (100 lines in one chunk, interleaved boundaries)
  - CRLF handling (normalized, mixed, bare `\r` preserved)
  - Flush behavior (unterminated lines, empty buffer, post-complete)
  - Reset behavior (discards buffer)
  - Serialization (objects, primitives, round-trip, Unicode round-trip)
- Fixed TS strict mode + Biome lint conflict: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` requires narrowing array access, but Biome forbids `!` assertions → created `lineAt()` safe accessor helper

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.4 — Implement JSONL parser in `packages/shared/`
- [x] 1A.5 — Write unit tests for JSONL parser

**Issues encountered:**
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + Biome `noNonNullAssertion` tension in tests — resolved with `lineAt()` helper

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.6 — Implement `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/`
- `PiProcess` wraps `Bun.spawn()` of `pi --mode rpc`, uses `JsonlParser` for stdout, handles lifecycle
- Then 1A.7 (PiRpcManager), 1A.8 (crash handling), 1A.9 (tests), 1A.10 (manual integration test)
- Use `@pibun/shared/jsonl` import path for the parser
- Bun's `Bun.spawn()` provides stdout as `ReadableStream` — need to pipe chunks through `JsonlParser.feed()`

---

## Session 5 — PiProcess Class (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/src/piProcess.ts` — the core subprocess wrapper for Pi RPC:
  - **Spawn**: Uses `Bun.spawn()` with all stdio piped. Builds CLI args from options (provider, model, thinking, session, etc.)
  - **Stdout reading**: Background async loop reads `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`, feeds chunks through `JsonlParser` from `@pibun/shared/jsonl`
  - **JSONL dispatch**: Parsed lines are dispatched — `type === "response"` goes to response listeners + pending request correlation; other types go to event listeners
  - **Command correlation**: `sendCommand()` auto-generates IDs, writes JSONL to stdin, returns `Promise<PiResponse>` with 30s timeout
  - **Extension UI**: `sendExtensionResponse()` writes fire-and-forget to stdin (uses original request ID)
  - **Stderr capture**: Background reader accumulates all stderr in buffer, notifies listeners
  - **Process lifecycle**: States: idle → running → stopped/crashed. `start()` spawns, `stop()` sends SIGTERM → 3s timeout → SIGKILL
  - **Crash detection**: If process exits while in "running" state, marks as "crashed" and rejects all pending requests
  - **Typed subprocess**: Uses `Subprocess<"pipe","pipe","pipe">` which gives `FileSink` stdin and `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` stdout/stderr
  - **5 listener types**: `onEvent`, `onResponse`, `onExit`, `onError`, `onStderr` — all return unsubscribe functions
- Fixed server tsconfig: removed `composite`, `declaration`, `declarationMap`, and `references` — workspace packages export `.ts` directly via package.json `exports`, so project references are unnecessary and caused TS6305 errors
- Fixed `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` issue with `Bun.spawn` cwd/env: always provide values (cwd defaults to `process.cwd()`, env always passes `process.env`)
- Fixed Biome import ordering: `@pibun/*` before `bun` (bare specifiers)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.6 — Implement `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/`

**Issues encountered:**
- TS6305 errors from project references expecting `.d.ts` files that don't exist — resolved by removing project references from server tsconfig
- Bun's `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` rejects `cwd: undefined` — resolved by always providing a value
- Biome import ordering: `bun` (bare specifier) sorts after `@pibun/*` (scoped packages)

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.7 — Implement `PiRpcManager` in `apps/server/`
- PiRpcManager maps session ID → PiProcess instance. Methods: `createSession()` → spawn PiProcess, `getSession()`, `stopSession()` → kill process, `stopAll()`
- Then: 1A.8 (crash/exit handling with cleanup), 1A.9 (unit tests with mock subprocess), 1A.10 (manual integration test)
- Key: PiProcess is fully functional but not yet tested. PiRpcManager is the next layer.
- Other app tsconfigs (desktop, web) may also need project references removed when they start importing workspace packages.

---

## Session 3 — Pi RPC Contract Types (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Defined complete Pi RPC type system in `packages/contracts/` across 4 files:
  - `piTypes.ts` — Base types: content blocks (text, thinking, image, toolCall), messages (user, assistant, toolResult, bashExecution), model, usage, session state, compaction/bash/session stats results, slash commands, thinking levels, stop reasons
  - `piEvents.ts` — 16 event types: agent lifecycle, turn lifecycle, message lifecycle, tool execution, auto-compaction, auto-retry, extension error, extension UI requests (9 methods: select, confirm, input, editor, notify, setStatus, setWidget, setTitle, set_editor_text)
  - `piCommands.ts` — 24 command types: prompting, state, model, thinking, queue modes, compaction, retry, bash, session management, slash commands. Plus 3 extension UI response types (value, confirm, cancel)
  - `piResponses.ts` — Per-command success responses + generic error response. `PiStdoutLine` union covers all possible JSONL from Pi stdout
  - `index.ts` — Re-exports all types (~80 type exports)
- All types are pure TypeScript interfaces/types — zero runtime code (Decision 12)
- Types modeled from authoritative Pi source (`reference/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts` and `rpc.md`)
- Verified: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes, types importable from `@pibun/contracts`

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.1 — Define Pi RPC event types in `packages/contracts/`
- [x] 1A.2 — Define Pi RPC command types in `packages/contracts/`
- [x] 1A.3 — Define Pi RPC response type in `packages/contracts/`

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.4 — Implement JSONL parser in `packages/shared/`
- The parser must split on `\n` only — see CONVENTIONS.md for the exact pattern
- `packages/shared/src/jsonl.ts` already exists as a stub with the correct export path (`@pibun/shared/jsonl`)
- After JSONL parser: 1A.5 (unit tests), then 1A.6 (PiProcess class in server)

---

## Session 7 — PiRpcManager Unit Tests (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created fake Pi binary at `apps/server/test-fixtures/fake-pi.ts`:
  - Executable Bun script with shebang, accepts same CLI args as `pi --mode rpc`
  - Reads JSONL from stdin, responds with success JSONL on stdout
  - Configurable via env vars: `FAKE_PI_CRASH_AFTER_MS`, `FAKE_PI_EXIT_CODE`, `FAKE_PI_STDERR`
- Wrote 37 unit tests in `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.test.ts` across 6 categories:
  - **Session creation** (6 tests): auto-generated IDs, custom IDs, duplicate rejection, process state, created event
  - **Session lookup** (7 tests): getSession, hasSession, size, getActiveSessions, getAllSessions
  - **Session stopping** (8 tests): stopSession removes/emits, no-op for unknown, safe double-stop, stopAll parallel, stopAll events
  - **Crash handling** (5 tests): crash detection with event, session removal on crash, stderr capture, crash isolation (other sessions unaffected), process state after crash
  - **Event listeners** (4 tests): event ordering (created→crashed), multiple listeners, unsubscribe, session ID delivery
  - **Command forwarding** (3 tests): send command through session, ID correlation, parallel commands to different sessions
  - **Edge cases** (4 tests): default options, size lifecycle, getSession after stop, hasSession after crash
- Fixed Biome lint issues: `process.env["KEY"]` → `process.env.KEY` (useLiteralKeys), `type` imports sorted before value imports, formatting

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.9 — Write unit tests for PiRpcManager (mock subprocess, verify event routing)

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome `useLiteralKeys` rule prefers `process.env.KEY` over bracket notation
- Biome sorts `type` imports before value imports within the same import statement

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.10 — Manual integration test: spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events
- This is the LAST item in Phase 1A — completing it means verifying exit criteria and marking phase complete
- The test should create a script that uses PiRpcManager to spawn a real Pi process, send "hello", and log all streaming events
- Requires `pi` installed locally with API keys (verified in Session 2 with Pi 0.61.1)
- After 1A.10, Phase 1A is complete → move to Phase 1B (WebSocket Bridge)

---

## Session 8 — Integration Test + Phase 1A Complete (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created integration test script at `apps/server/src/integration-test.ts`:
  - Spawns a real Pi RPC process via PiRpcManager (anthropic/sonnet/low thinking, ephemeral mode)
  - Sends `get_state` command first (no API cost) to verify connectivity
  - Sends a minimal prompt ("Respond with exactly one word: hello") to test streaming
  - Logs all events, responses, stderr, and errors with timestamps
  - Waits for `agent_end` event, then cleanly stops all sessions
- Ran the test successfully against Pi 0.61.1:
  - `get_state` returned model info (claude-sonnet-4-6, thinking=low)
  - Prompt produced full streaming event lifecycle: agent_start → turn_start → message_start (user) → message_end (user) → message_start (assistant) → message_update (text_start, text_delta: "hello", text_end) → message_end (assistant) → turn_end → agent_end
  - Session stopped cleanly with no errors
  - Total cost: ~$0.015 (mostly cache write tokens)
- Fixed two type errors: `PiPromptCommand.message` is `string` (not content blocks), `PiResponse.data` requires narrowing via `command` field
- **Phase 1A exit criteria verified**: test script spawns Pi via RPC, sends "hello", logs all streaming events, process cleanup works on exit

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.10 — Manual integration test: spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events

**Issues encountered:**
- `PiPromptCommand.message` type is `string`, not `PiTextContent[]` — fixed immediately
- `PiResponse` discriminated union requires narrowing via `command` field before accessing `data` — fixed by adding `stateResp.command === "get_state"` check

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Phase 1A is COMPLETE** — all 10 items done, exit criteria met
- Next: Phase 1B.1 — Define WebSocket protocol types in `packages/contracts/`
- Read `docs/WS_PROTOCOL.md` for the WebSocket message contract
- Key types needed: WsRequest (method + params + id), WsResponse (result/error + id), WsPush (channel + data), method strings
- The server needs HTTP + WebSocket setup (Bun.serve with websocket handler)
- Reference `reference/t3code/packages/contracts/src/ws.ts` for patterns (but use our simpler method string approach)

---

## Session 6 — PiRpcManager + Crash Handling (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `PiRpcManager` class in `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.ts`:
  - **Session mapping**: `Map<string, ManagedSession>` with auto-generated IDs (`session_{counter}_{timestamp}`)
  - **createSession()**: Accepts `CreateSessionOptions` (extends `PiProcessOptions` with optional custom `sessionId`), spawns PiProcess, wires crash listeners, emits "created" event
  - **getSession()**: Lookup by ID, returns `ManagedSession | undefined`
  - **getActiveSessions()**: Filters to only "running" state processes
  - **getAllSessions()**: Returns all sessions regardless of state
  - **stopSession()**: Removes from map FIRST (prevents re-entrant cleanup), then stops process, emits "stopped" event
  - **stopAll()**: Parallel `Promise.all` stop of all sessions — used for server shutdown
  - **Crash handling** (1A.8): `attachProcessListeners()` wires `onExit` + `onError` to each PiProcess. On unexpected exit (state === "crashed"), captures stderr, removes session, emits `{ type: "crashed", exitCode, stderr }`. Non-fatal errors (parse failures) don't remove the session.
  - **Session events**: `onSessionEvent()` listener with unsubscribe. Events: created, stopped, crashed.
  - **Cleanup**: `removeSession()` deletes from sessions map AND unsubscribes all PiProcess listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed unused import warning (`PiProcessState` not needed in manager)
- Verified: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes (0 warnings)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.7 — Implement `PiRpcManager` in `apps/server/`
- [x] 1A.8 — Handle Pi process crash/exit (emit error event, clean up session, log stderr)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.9 — Write unit tests for PiRpcManager (mock subprocess, verify event routing)
- Then: 1A.10 — Manual integration test (spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events)
- PiRpcManager is at `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.ts`. It depends on `PiProcess` from `./piProcess.js`
- Key test scenarios: create/get/stop session, duplicate ID rejection, crash detection with stderr capture, stopAll parallel, listener cleanup on session removal
- For mocking: PiProcess spawns `Bun.spawn()` — tests will need to either mock the subprocess or use a fake Pi binary (a script that echoes JSONL)

---

## Session 9 — WebSocket Protocol Types (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created `packages/contracts/src/wsProtocol.ts` with complete WebSocket protocol type definitions
- Defined `WS_METHODS` (17 methods across 5 domains: lifecycle, prompting, model/settings, session management, extension UI) and `WS_CHANNELS` (4 push channels: pi.event, pi.response, server.welcome, server.error)
- Created per-method params interfaces (9 methods have params, 8 are parameterless)
- Created per-method result interfaces (WsOkResult for simple acks, typed results for queries)
- Created `WsMethodParamsMap`, `WsMethodResultMap`, `WsChannelDataMap` type maps for compile-time safety
- Created wire envelope types: `WsRequest`, `WsResponseOk`, `WsResponseError`, `WsResponse`, `WsPush`, `WsServerMessage`
- Created generic typed variants: `WsTypedRequest<M>`, `WsTypedResponseOk<M>`, `WsTypedResponse<M>`, `WsTypedPush<C>`
- Updated `index.ts` to re-export all new types and the two const objects
- Fixed Biome formatting (multi-line union → single-line)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1B.1 — Define WebSocket protocol types in `packages/contracts/` (WsRequest, WsResponse, WsPush, method strings, push channels)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1B.2 — Set up Bun HTTP server with health endpoint (`/health`)
- The WS protocol types are ready for both server (dispatch) and client (transport) consumption
- `WsTypedRequest<M>` uses conditional params (never for parameterless methods) — useful for the WsTransport `send()` method
- Server will import `WS_METHODS` const for method routing and type maps for handler signatures

---

## Session 10 — Server Infrastructure: HTTP + WebSocket (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created `apps/server/src/server.ts` — Bun HTTP + WebSocket server with `createServer()` factory
- Implemented `/health` endpoint returning JSON with status, connection count, uptime
- Implemented static file serving from `apps/web/dist/` with SPA fallback (no-extension paths serve `index.html`), MIME type map, directory traversal protection
- Implemented WebSocket upgrade handling with per-connection `WsConnectionData` (id, sessionId, connectedAt)
- Connection tracking via `Set<ServerWebSocket<WsConnectionData>>` with add on open, remove on close
- Updated `apps/server/src/index.ts` entry point — bootstraps PiRpcManager + server, graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Verified server starts, health endpoint responds, unknown paths return 404, WebSocket connections establish and close cleanly

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1B.2 — Set up Bun HTTP server with health endpoint (`/health`)
- [x] 1B.3 — Static file serving (serve `apps/web/dist/` in production)
- [x] 1B.4 — WebSocket upgrade handling with connection tracking

**Issues encountered:**
- Bun's `Server` generic requires explicit type parameter — `Server<WsConnectionData>` not just `Server`
- `server.upgrade()` does NOT accept type arguments — inferred from `Bun.serve<T>()`. Calling `server.upgrade<T>()` causes TS2558.
- Biome enforces `process.env.KEY` dot notation, not `process.env["KEY"]` (MEMORY #38)

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1B.5 — Implement request/response dispatch (method string → handler function)
- `server.ts` has a stub `message()` handler ready for dispatch wiring
- `WsConnectionData.sessionId` is null until a `session.start` handler binds it
- The `connections` Set is available for broadcasting (needed for 1B.10 Pi event forwarding)
- Consider creating `apps/server/src/handlers/` directory for per-domain handler files

---

## Session 11 — WebSocket Dispatch + All Session Handlers (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented the WebSocket request/response dispatch system in server.ts
- Created the handlers/ directory structure (types.ts, session.ts, index.ts)
- Implemented all 17 WS method handlers in session.ts following thin bridge pattern
- Wired Pi event and response forwarding from PiProcess to WebSocket clients
- Added server.welcome push on WebSocket connect
- Wrote 10 unit tests for dispatch covering validation, error handling, routing, and session.start
- All 47 tests pass (10 new dispatch + 37 existing PiRpcManager)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1B.5 — Implement request/response dispatch (method string → handler function)
- [x] 1B.6 — Implement `session.start` → spawn Pi RPC via PiRpcManager
- [x] 1B.7 — Implement `session.prompt` → forward to Pi process stdin
- [x] 1B.8 — Implement `session.abort` → forward abort to Pi
- [x] 1B.9 — Implement `session.stop` → stop Pi process
- [x] 1B.10 — Pi event forwarding on `pi.event` channel
- [x] 1B.11 — Pi response forwarding on `pi.response` channel
- [x] 1B.12 — `server.welcome` push on WebSocket connect
- [x] 1B.13 — Write unit tests for WebSocket message routing

**Issues encountered:**
- Function contravariance: `WsHandler<M>` (with specific params type) not assignable to `AnyWsHandler` (with `unknown` params). Solved with `any` at registry level + biome-ignore.
- Circular dependency: session.ts needed `sendPush` from server.ts which imports handlers. Solved by injecting `sendPush` via HandlerContext.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` in createSession: can't pass undefined for optional PiProcessOptions. Solved with conditional spread pattern.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1B.14 — Test with wscat (manual integration test of full round-trip)
- This is the last item in Phase 1B. After verifying exit criteria, mark phase complete and EXIT.

---

### Session 11 addendum — 1B.14 (Phase 1B complete)

**Additional work:**
- Wrote `ws-integration-test.ts` — scripted equivalent of manual wscat test
- Full round-trip verified: connect → welcome → start session → prompt → 12 streaming events → text "Hello PiBun" → stop
- Phase 1B exit criteria verified and met

**Phase 1B Exit Criteria Status:**
- ✅ Full round-trip works via WebSocket (wscat-equivalent test passes)
- ✅ Events stream in real-time (12 pi.event pushes for a single prompt)
- ✅ Session start/stop/abort all function
- ✅ All 47 unit tests pass + integration test passes
- ✅ `bun run typecheck && bun run lint` passes

**Handoff to next session:**
- Phase 1B is COMPLETE. Next phase: 1C — Web UI: Minimal Chat
- First item: 1C.1 — Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4 setup in `apps/web/`
- The server is fully functional and tested. The web UI connects to `ws://localhost:24242`.

---

## Session 12 — WsTransport + Web Setup Verification (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Verified existing Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4 setup builds and typechecks (was scaffolded in Phase 0)
- Added Zustand 5.0.12 as dependency for state management
- Cleaned up web tsconfig — removed `composite`, `declaration`, `declarationMap`, `references` (same fix as server, MEMORY #31)
- Added Vite dev proxy: `/ws` → `ws://localhost:24242` for WebSocket proxying during development
- Implemented `WsTransport` class in `apps/web/src/transport.ts`:
  - **Connection lifecycle**: connect, reconnect with exponential backoff (500ms → 8s cap), dispose
  - **Request/response**: type-safe `request<M extends WsMethod>()` with variadic args for optional params, auto-ID correlation, 60s timeout, pending request map
  - **Push subscriptions**: `subscribe<C extends WsChannel>()` with typed data payloads, latest-push replay option
  - **Outbound queue**: messages queued during disconnect, flushed on reconnect
  - **State tracking**: connecting → open → closed → reconnecting cycle, `onStateChange()` listener for Zustand integration
  - **Latest push cache**: stores most recent push per channel for `getLatestPush()` and replay
  - **URL inference**: auto-detects ws/wss from page protocol, configurable via constructor

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.1 — Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4 setup in `apps/web/`
- [x] 1C.2 — Implement `WsTransport` class

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.3 — Create Zustand store: `connection` slice
- Then: 1C.4 (session slice), 1C.5 (messages slice), 1C.6 (wire WsTransport → Zustand)
- Items 1C.3-1C.5 are small store slices — could combine into one session
- 1C.6 is the critical wiring: pi.event push → state updates (see event→state mapping in WEB_UI.md)
- The WsTransport is at `apps/web/src/transport.ts` — Zustand store needs to instantiate it and subscribe to state changes + push channels
- Key: `WsTransport.onStateChange()` feeds the connection slice, `subscribe("pi.event", ...)` feeds the messages slice

---

## Session 13 — Zustand Store Slices (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created `apps/web/src/store/` directory with 5 files:
  - `types.ts` — `ChatMessage` type (non-optional fields for `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`), `ChatToolCall`, `ChatToolResult`, slice interfaces (`ConnectionSlice`, `SessionSlice`, `MessagesSlice`), combined `AppStore` type
  - `connectionSlice.ts` — WebSocket transport status + reconnect attempt counter
  - `sessionSlice.ts` — Pi session ID, model, thinking level, streaming flag, stats, reset action
  - `messagesSlice.ts` — Messages array with streaming-optimized actions: `appendMessage`, `appendToContent`, `appendToThinking`, `setMessageStreaming`, `updateToolOutput` (accumulated/replace), `finalizeToolResult`, `setMessages`, `clearMessages`. Uses reverse-scan `findMessageIndex` for O(1)-ish tail updates.
  - `index.ts` — Combines slices via `create<AppStore>()((...a) => ({ ...slice1(...a), ...slice2(...a), ...slice3(...a) }))`, re-exports types
- Zustand slice pattern uses `StateCreator<AppStore, [], [], SliceType>` generic for cross-slice type safety

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.3 — Create Zustand store: `connection` slice (status, reconnectAttempt)
- [x] 1C.4 — Create Zustand store: `session` slice (isStreaming, model, thinkingLevel)
- [x] 1C.5 — Create Zustand store: `messages` slice (ChatMessage array, append, update streaming message)

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome sorts `@/` path alias imports before `@pibun/` scoped packages (alphabetical: `@/` < `@p`). Fixed immediately.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.6 — Wire WsTransport → Zustand (pi.event push → state updates)
- The WsTransport is at `apps/web/src/transport.ts`, store at `apps/web/src/store/`
- Key: subscribe to `pi.event` push channel, map each event type to store actions (see WEB_UI.md event→state mapping)
- Also need to wire `WsTransport.onStateChange()` → `setConnectionStatus`
- Consider creating a `bridge.ts` or wiring in `App.tsx` with a useEffect

---
## Session 14 — Wire WsTransport → Zustand (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created `apps/web/src/wireTransport.ts` — the event wiring module that bridges WsTransport push channels to Zustand store actions
  - `initTransport()` creates singleton WsTransport, subscribes to all channels, returns cleanup function
  - `getTransport()` provides singleton access for sending requests (Composer, etc.)
  - `handlePiEvent()` dispatches all Pi event types to appropriate store actions:
    - `agent_start/end` → `setIsStreaming()`
    - `message_start` → `appendMessage()` with user/assistant ChatMessage
    - `message_update` → `appendToContent()` / `appendToThinking()` for text/thinking deltas
    - `message_end` → `setMessageStreaming(false)`
    - `tool_execution_start` → creates both tool_call card + tool_result placeholder
    - `tool_execution_update` → `updateToolOutput()` (accumulated, not delta)
    - `tool_execution_end` → `finalizeToolResult()`
    - `auto_compaction/retry` → system messages
    - Extension events → no-op (Phase 1D)
  - Transport state changes → `setConnectionStatus()` / `setReconnectAttempt()`
  - `server.welcome` / `server.error` → console logging
- Updated `WsTransport.inferUrl()` to append `/ws` path for Vite dev proxy compatibility
- Updated `main.tsx` to call `initTransport()` before React renders
- Helper functions: `extractText()` for tool results, `extractUserContent()` for user messages, `makeMessage()` with defaults
- Module-level tracking: `currentAssistantMessageId` for routing streaming deltas, `messageIdCounter` for unique IDs

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.6 — Wire WsTransport → Zustand (pi.event push → state updates)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.7 — Build AppShell layout (sidebar placeholder left, main chat area right, composer bottom)
- Transport wiring is complete — events will flow into Zustand store when connected to a running server
- `getTransport()` is the API for sending requests from UI components (e.g., `getTransport().request("session.prompt", { message })`)
- Session auto-start not yet implemented — will need to be triggered somewhere (Composer or App on mount)
- The Vite proxy is configured at `/ws` path — transport connects to `ws://host:port/ws`

---

## Session 15 — AppShell + Composer (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Built the AppShell layout component with sidebar placeholder (hidden on mobile) and main chat area (ChatView + Composer)
- Built the Composer with multi-line textarea, auto-resize, Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline, abort button during streaming, send button with enabled/disabled states
- Composer auto-starts a Pi session on first prompt via `ensureSession()` — checks store for sessionId, calls `session.start` if none exists
- Built ConnectionBanner showing connecting/reconnecting/disconnected state
- Built ChatView placeholder — basic rendering of all message types (user/assistant/tool_call/tool_result/system) with empty state prompt
- Created `cn()` className utility at `src/lib/cn.ts`
- Updated App.tsx to render AppShell instead of the placeholder
- Fixed Biome lint: SVG accessibility (added `aria-label` + `role="img"`), import ordering (`type` imports sort before value imports)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.7 — Build AppShell layout (sidebar placeholder left, main chat area right, composer bottom)
- [x] 1C.8 — Build Composer (multi-line input, Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline, abort button during streaming)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.9 — Build ChatView (render user messages and assistant text blocks)
- ChatView placeholder exists at `src/components/ChatView.tsx` — needs proper message rendering, auto-scroll, and streaming cursor
- The Composer's `handleSend` calls `ensureSession()` → `session.start` → `session.prompt` — this is the session auto-start flow
- ConnectionBanner is wired to the connection slice and renders above ChatView in AppShell
- All new components follow conventions: Tailwind classes, `cn()` helper, Zustand selectors, no data fetching in components

---

## Session 16 — ChatView with Message Sub-Components (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Rewrote ChatView from placeholder to full implementation with dedicated message sub-components
- Created `apps/web/src/components/chat/` directory with 5 memoized components:
  - `UserMessage.tsx` — right-aligned bubble with pre-wrapped text
  - `AssistantMessage.tsx` — streaming cursor (pulsing block), collapsible thinking section (chevron toggle, max-height 60, scroll overflow), content area with streaming indicator
  - `ToolCallMessage.tsx` — collapsible card with tool icon, name, args summary; expand to see full JSON args. Tool icons for common Pi tools (bash, read, edit, write, glob, grep)
  - `ToolResultMessage.tsx` — collapsible output with 8-line threshold, fade gradient, "Show all N lines" toggle. Error results shown in red. Streaming placeholder text while running
  - `SystemMessage.tsx` — centered text with horizontal divider lines on both sides
- ChatView now uses `MessageItem` switch component (memoized) to dispatch to the right sub-component
- Added "Pi is thinking…" streaming indicator with pulsing dot for gap between agent_start and first message
- Empty state shows 🥧 emoji with helpful prompt text
- `scrollContainerRef` added to ChatView div (will be used in 1C.11 for auto-scroll)
- Fixed Biome formatting (ran `bun run format` to fix 4 files)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.9 — Build ChatView — render user messages and assistant text blocks

**Issues encountered:**
- None — clean implementation, all typecheck and lint passed after formatting

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.10 — Wire text_delta streaming (append to current message content in real-time)
- Note: text_delta streaming is already wired in `wireTransport.ts` (handleMessageUpdate dispatches `text_delta` → `appendToContent`, `thinking_delta` → `appendToThinking`). Item 1C.10 may just need verification that the ChatView correctly renders streaming content.
- After that: 1C.11 (auto-scroll), 1C.12 (basic tool output — largely done, may just need verification), 1C.13 (loading/error states), 1C.14 (Vite proxy — already done in MEMORY #60), 1C.15 (end-to-end test)
- The ChatView's `scrollContainerRef` is ready for auto-scroll implementation in 1C.11

---

## Session 17 — Auto-scroll, Error Indicators, Verify Previously Built Items (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Verified 1C.10 (text_delta streaming), 1C.12 (tool output rendering), 1C.14 (Vite dev proxy) — all previously implemented in sessions 13–16
- Implemented `useAutoScroll` hook in `apps/web/src/hooks/useAutoScroll.ts` — passive scroll tracking via `isAtBottomRef`, `useLayoutEffect` for flicker-free auto-scroll, floating "↓ New messages" button when scrolled up
- Integrated auto-scroll into ChatView with relative positioning for the floating button
- Added `lastError`/`setLastError`/`clearLastError` to ConnectionSlice for error state management
- Created `ErrorBanner` component — dismissible red banner with error icon, auto-clears after 10 seconds
- Wired `server.error` push channel to `setLastError` in wireTransport.ts
- Updated Composer to surface session/prompt/abort errors via `setLastError` instead of silent console.error
- Added ErrorBanner to AppShell layout (between ConnectionBanner and ChatView)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.10 — Wire text_delta streaming (verified — already wired in wireTransport.ts)
- [x] 1C.11 — Auto-scroll to bottom on new content, "↓ New messages" button when scrolled up
- [x] 1C.12 — Basic tool output rendering (verified — ToolCallMessage + ToolResultMessage)
- [x] 1C.13 — Loading/connecting/error state indicators
- [x] 1C.14 — Wire Vite dev proxy to server (verified — already in vite.config.ts)

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome `useExhaustiveDependencies` caught missing `setLastError` in Composer's `handleSend` useCallback deps — fixed immediately

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1C.15 — End-to-end test: open browser → type prompt → see streaming response with tool calls
- This is the LAST item in Phase 1C. Must verify exit criteria: "Working chat with Pi in the browser. Streaming text renders smoothly. Tool calls visible. Session starts automatically on page load."
- Requires running both server (`bun run dev:server`) and web (`bun run dev:web`), then testing in browser
- May need to verify Pi is installed and API keys are configured

---

## Session 18 — E2E Test + Phase 1C Complete (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Built the web app (`vite build` — 50 modules, 217KB JS bundle)
- Wrote comprehensive E2E test at `apps/server/src/e2e-test.ts` (44 checks)
- Test validates the full browser-to-Pi chain programmatically:
  - Web build verification (dist exists, index.html, JS bundle)
  - Static file serving (GET /, /health, SPA fallback, 404 for missing files)
  - WebSocket connection (connect, server.welcome push with cwd+version)
  - Session lifecycle (session.start returns sessionId, session.stop succeeds)
  - Prompt + streaming (session.prompt acknowledged, all Pi events streamed)
  - Agent lifecycle validation (agent_start/end, turn_start/end ordering)
  - Message events (message_start with roles, message_update with text_delta, message_end)
  - Text accumulation (text_delta appended correctly, non-empty result)
  - Tool execution (tool_execution_start with toolCallId/toolName, tool_execution_end with result/isError)
  - wireTransport.ts compatibility (all events have correct structure for Zustand dispatch)
- Discovered: fast tools (like `read` for small files) skip `tool_execution_update` events entirely
- All 44 checks pass, Phase 1C exit criteria fully verified

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1C.15 — End-to-end test: open browser → type prompt → see streaming response with tool calls

**Issues encountered:**
- `tool_execution_update` events are not emitted for fast tools — Pi goes directly from start to end. Made this an informational note rather than a hard failure in the test.

**Handoff to next session:**
- **PHASE 1C IS COMPLETE** — all 15 items done, exit criteria verified
- Next: Phase 1D — Web UI: Full Features
- First item: 1D.1 — Thinking blocks (collapsible section, streaming via thinking_delta)
- The wireTransport.ts already handles `thinking_delta` events (appends to `thinking` field on ChatMessage)
- AssistantMessage already has a collapsible thinking section — 1D.1 may just need testing/refinement
- Consider: markdown rendering (1D.4) and syntax highlighting (1D.3) are high-impact items that will significantly improve the chat experience

---

## Session 19 — Thinking Blocks + Tool Execution Cards (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Enhanced `AssistantMessage.tsx` thinking section (1D.1):
  - Auto-expand thinking section while streaming (thinking arriving, no content yet)
  - Auto-collapse when main content starts, unless user explicitly toggled
  - `userToggledRef` pattern prevents auto-behavior from overriding manual toggle
  - Brain icon with pulse animation during active thinking
  - Character count indicator (e.g., "2.3k chars") shown when collapsed and not streaming
  - Indigo tint for active thinking section (indigo-500/30 border, indigo-950/20 bg)
  - Increased max-height from 60 to 80 for more content visibility
- Created `ToolExecutionCard.tsx` (1D.2) — unified card combining tool_call + tool_result:
  - Header: tool emoji icon + name + tool-specific args summary + status badge + chevron
  - Tool-specific summaries: bash=command, read/edit/write=path, glob/grep=pattern
  - Three status states: running (blue pulse dot), success (green check), error (red X)
  - Expandable body: args JSON + output with collapsible long output (12-line threshold)
  - Collapsed view: first output line preview or "Running..." indicator
  - Visual distinction: blue border while running, red border on error, neutral when done
- Updated `ChatView.tsx` to group tool_call + tool_result into unified items:
  - `groupMessages()` function scans message array, pairs adjacent tool_call + tool_result
  - `ChatItem` union type: `{ kind: "message" }` | `{ kind: "tool_group" }`
  - `ChatItemRenderer` dispatches to ToolExecutionCard or MessageItem
  - Memoized with `useMemo` to avoid re-grouping on every render
  - Original ToolCallMessage/ToolResultMessage retained as fallback for orphan messages

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.1 — Thinking blocks (collapsible section, streaming via thinking_delta)
- [x] 1D.2 — Tool call cards (tool name + args header, expandable output body)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.3 — Syntax highlighting for code blocks (Shiki, lazy-loaded per language)
- Consider doing 1D.3 + 1D.4 (markdown rendering) together since they're closely related
- Shiki needs to be lazy-loaded per language to avoid large upfront bundle
- react-markdown with rehype-shiki or similar integration for rendering
- Current assistant text is `whitespace-pre-wrap` in a `<p>` — needs to become proper markdown

---

## Session 20 — Syntax Highlighting + Markdown Rendering (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Installed `shiki@4.0.2`, `react-markdown@10.1.0`, `remark-gfm@4.0.1` in apps/web
- Created `apps/web/src/lib/highlighter.ts` — Shiki singleton with lazy language loading:
  - Uses `shiki/bundle/web` (lighter than full bundle, web-focused languages)
  - `createHighlighter` called once with zero langs, theme `github-dark-default`
  - Languages loaded on demand via `loadLanguage()` when first code block of that lang appears
  - `loadedLanguages` Set tracks what's been loaded; `availableLanguages` Set for fast validation
  - Unsupported languages gracefully fall back to plain "text" rendering
- Created `apps/web/src/components/CodeBlock.tsx` — syntax-highlighted code block:
  - Async highlight via `useEffect` → `highlightCode()` → sets `html` state
  - Plain text `<pre><code>` fallback while highlighter loads
  - Copy-to-clipboard button (appears on hover, "Copied" confirmation for 2s)
  - Language label in header bar
  - Shiki output rendered via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (safe — Shiki only transforms code strings)
  - Memoized with `React.memo`
- Created `apps/web/src/components/Markdown.tsx` — markdown renderer:
  - `react-markdown` with `remark-gfm` for GFM support (tables, strikethrough, task lists, autolinks)
  - Custom component overrides for all markdown elements (dark theme styling with Tailwind)
  - `pre` component returns bare Fragment (avoids HTMLPreElement/HTMLDivElement ref type mismatch)
  - `code` component detects block vs inline: className presence OR multi-line → CodeBlock, else inline style
  - Full element coverage: h1-h4, p, ul/ol/li, a (target=_blank), blockquote, table/thead/th/td, hr, strong/em/del, img
  - Named `MarkdownContent` to avoid collision with react-markdown's own `Markdown` export
- Updated `AssistantMessage.tsx` to use `MarkdownContent` instead of `<p className="whitespace-pre-wrap">`
- Fixed: react-markdown v10 uses default export, not named export
- Fixed: Biome a11y `useAltText` rule on img — use `alt || "Image"` and don't spread props after
- Vite build produces ~130 separate lazy-loaded chunks for Shiki grammars/themes

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.3 — Syntax highlighting for code blocks (Shiki, lazy-loaded per language)
- [x] 1D.4 — Markdown rendering for assistant text (react-markdown + remark-gfm)

**Issues encountered:**
- react-markdown v10 changed to default export (from named export in earlier versions)
- Spreading `...props` from `<pre>` onto `<div>` caused TS ref type mismatch — solved by discarding props
- Biome static analysis couldn't verify `alt` was set when `...props` was spread after — solved by not spreading

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.5 — Tool-specific output rendering (bash as terminal, read as highlighted code, edit as diff, write as file preview)
- CodeBlock component is ready to reuse for tool output rendering (read tool → CodeBlock with file extension as language)
- Consider: ToolExecutionCard.tsx currently shows raw `<pre>` for output — needs to dispatch to tool-specific renderers
- The `summarizeArgs` function in ToolExecutionCard already extracts paths/commands per tool — reuse for language detection

---
## Session 21 — Tool-Specific Output Rendering (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Built 4 specialized tool output renderers in `components/chat/tools/`:
  - `BashOutput` — terminal-style UI with dark background, command line display (green `$` prompt), monospace output, streaming cursor
  - `ReadOutput` — file path header with icon, syntax-highlighted content via CodeBlock, supports offset/limit range display
  - `EditOutput` — unified diff view with red −removed / green +added lines, collapsible for long diffs, file path header with edit icon
  - `WriteOutput` — file preview with syntax-highlighted content via CodeBlock, "written" badge, collapsible for long files
- Created `ToolOutput` dispatcher that routes to specialized renderers or `DefaultOutput` (raw pre) for unknown tools
- Created `lib/fileUtils.ts` with 70+ extension→language mappings, filename-based fallbacks (Dockerfile, Makefile, etc.), and helper functions (`inferLanguageFromPath`, `getFileName`, `getFileExtension`, `shortPath`)
- Refactored `ToolExecutionCard` to use `SPECIALIZED_TOOLS` Set — specialized tools get `<ToolOutput>` in expanded body, others get legacy `<DefaultExpandedBody>` with raw args/output
- Extracted `DefaultExpandedBody` as its own memoized component (cleaner separation)
- All renderers handle 3 states: running (streaming cursor), success, error (red text)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.5 — Tool-specific output rendering: bash as terminal, read as highlighted code with path, edit as diff view, write as file preview

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome formatter collapsed multi-line JSX return for `DefaultOutput` and removed parens around single-expression JSX — fixed with `bun run format`

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.6 — Model selector UI (list from `get_available_models`, grouped by provider)
- The `get_available_models` WebSocket method exists and handler is wired (`handlers/session.ts`)
- Need a `models` slice in Zustand store or extend `SessionSlice` to hold available models list
- Consider dropdown/popover UI pattern for model selection
- 1D.7 (thinking level selector) and 1D.8 (wire model/thinking commands) are closely related — could combine

---

## Session 22 — Model Selector UI (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Added `ModelsSlice` to Zustand store types (`availableModels`, `modelsLoading`, actions)
- Created `modelsSlice.ts` following existing `StateCreator` pattern
- Wired `ModelsSlice` into combined AppStore in `store/index.ts`
- Built `ModelSelector` component with:
  - Trigger button showing current model name + chevron icon
  - Dropdown panel with models grouped by `provider` field
  - Provider-grouped list with reasoning/vision badges per model
  - Lazy fetch: models fetched via `session.getModels` on first dropdown open
  - Refresh button to re-fetch models
  - Optimistic model selection: updates store immediately, reverts on error
  - Click-outside and Escape to close dropdown
  - Disabled state when not connected or no session
  - Active model indicator (blue dot + highlight)
  - Model ID and context window size shown as secondary info
- Added toolbar bar to AppShell (between ErrorBanner and ChatView)
- ModelSelector placed in toolbar, ready for ThinkingSelector next

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.6 — Model selector UI (list from `get_available_models`, grouped by provider)

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome formatter adjusted multi-line `cn()` call and ternary operator formatting — fixed with `bun run format`

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.7 — Thinking level selector (off → xhigh)
- Toolbar bar is already in AppShell — just add ThinkingSelector next to ModelSelector
- 1D.8 (wire model/thinking commands) is already partially done: ModelSelector calls `session.setModel`, ThinkingSelector will call `session.setThinking`
- Consider combining 1D.7 + 1D.8 since they're closely related

---

## Session 23 — Thinking Level Selector + Wire Model/Thinking Commands (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Built `ThinkingSelector` component at `apps/web/src/components/ThinkingSelector.tsx`:
  - Trigger button showing current thinking level name + brain icon + chevron
  - Dropdown panel with all 6 thinking levels: off, minimal, low, medium, high, xhigh
  - Each level has label, description, and visual intensity bar (6 small rectangles filled proportionally)
  - Optimistic level selection: updates store immediately, reverts on error
  - Click-outside and Escape to close dropdown
  - Disabled state when not connected or no session
  - Active level indicator (blue dot + highlight) matching ModelSelector pattern
  - Calls `session.setThinking` via WsTransport on selection
- Added ThinkingSelector to AppShell toolbar next to ModelSelector
- Verified 1D.8 (wire model/thinking commands): ModelSelector already calls `session.setModel` (since session 22), ThinkingSelector now calls `session.setThinking`. Server handlers were built in session 11.

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.7 — Thinking level selector (off → xhigh)
- [x] 1D.8 — Wire model/thinking commands (session.setModel, session.setThinking)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.9 — Session management (new session, switch session, fork from message)
- This is a medium/large item involving multiple WS commands: `session.new`, `session.switchSession` (need to check if this exists), `session.fork`
- The server handlers for `session.new` and `session.fork` are already wired in `handlers/session.ts`
- Will need UI components for session list and fork point selection
- 1D.10 (session stats) and 1D.11 (compaction controls) are independent and could be done in parallel

---

## Session 24 — Session Management: New Session + Fork (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Added `session.getForkMessages` WS method end-to-end:
  - Contracts: `WsForkableMessage` type, `WsSessionGetForkMessagesResult`, method/params/result map entries
  - Server: `handleSessionGetForkMessages` handler wrapping Pi's `get_fork_messages` command
  - Handler registry: registered new handler
- Created `apps/web/src/lib/sessionActions.ts` — coordinated async operations for session management:
  - `startNewSession()` — abort if streaming → ensure session → call `session.new` → clear messages → refresh state
  - `getForkableMessages()` — ensure session → call `session.getForkMessages` → return list
  - `forkFromMessage(entryId)` — abort if streaming → call `session.fork` → clear messages → refresh state
  - Shared `ensureSession()` and `refreshSessionState()` helpers
- Built `NewSessionButton` component — toolbar button with plus icon, calls `startNewSession()`, disabled when not connected or creating
- Built `ForkDialog` component — dropdown with forkable message list:
  - Trigger button with git-branch icon
  - Opens dropdown, fetches forkable messages from Pi
  - Loading spinner, empty state, and message list with text previews
  - Click-outside close, Escape close
  - Disabled when no session exists
- Updated `AppShell` — added session management controls (NewSessionButton + ForkDialog) to the right side of the toolbar, separated by a border divider

**Design decisions:**
- Fork uses a toolbar-level dropdown picker rather than per-message buttons. Pi's fork messages use internal `entryId`s that don't map to our ChatMessage IDs. This approach avoids needing to track entry IDs.
- `switch_session` deferred to 1D.17 (sidebar). Pi's `switch_session` command takes a `sessionPath` but Pi has no `list_sessions` RPC command. A full session list needs the sidebar UI.

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.9 — Session management: new session, switch session, fork from message

**Issues encountered:**
- `WsForkableMessage` needed to be added to the contracts index.ts exports — initial typecheck failed until export was added

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.10 — Session stats display (tokens, cost from get_session_stats)
- `session.getStats` WS method and server handler already exist
- Need a stats display component — could go in toolbar or sidebar area
- 1D.11 (compaction controls) is independent and could be combined with 1D.10

---

## Session 25 — Session Stats Display (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Added `fetchSessionStats()` to `apps/web/src/lib/sessionActions.ts` — calls `session.getStats` via transport, updates Zustand store's `stats` field. Silent failure (console.warn only, no error banner — stats are non-critical).
- Wired stats fetching in `wireTransport.ts` — `agent_end` event handler now calls `fetchSessionStats()` after each agent turn completes. Import added at top following Biome's `@/` before `@pibun/` sort order.
- Created `SessionStats` component at `apps/web/src/components/SessionStats.tsx`:
  - Compact trigger button: token icon + total tokens (formatted as k/M) + cost (formatted as $X.XX)
  - Expandable detail panel with three sections: token breakdown (input/output/cache read/cache write/total), message counts (user/assistant/tool/total), and total cost
  - Refresh button in panel header
  - Pulse animation on trigger while streaming
  - Same dropdown UX pattern as ModelSelector (click-outside close, Escape close)
  - Only renders when connected, has session, and stats are available
- Added `SessionStats` to AppShell toolbar — positioned between the spacer and session controls (right side of toolbar, before new/fork buttons)
- Biome format fix applied (one line too long in JSX)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.10 — Session stats display (tokens, cost from get_session_stats)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.11 — Compaction controls (manual compact button, auto-compaction start/end indicators)
- `session.compact` WS method and server handler already exist (handleSessionCompact in session.ts)
- Auto-compaction events already handled in wireTransport.ts (system messages for start/end)
- Need a manual compact button in toolbar + possibly visual indicators during compaction
- 10 items remaining in Phase 1D

---

## Session 26 — Compaction Controls (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Added `isCompacting` boolean to SessionSlice (types.ts + sessionSlice.ts) — tracks whether context compaction is in progress from either manual trigger or auto-compaction events
- Added `setIsCompacting` action to SessionSlice
- Updated `wireTransport.ts` — `auto_compaction_start` now sets `isCompacting=true`, `auto_compaction_end` sets `isCompacting=false`. Also added emoji prefixes to system messages (`⚙️`/`✅`/`⚠️`) for visual distinction
- Created `compactSession()` action in `sessionActions.ts` — calls `session.compact` via transport with optimistic `isCompacting=true`, resets in finally-block as fallback (auto_compaction_end event is the primary reset)
- Created `CompactButton` component — toolbar button with compress icon:
  - Disabled when not connected, no session, already compacting, or streaming
  - Shows "Compacting…" with spinning icon during compaction
  - Amber tint while compacting
  - Only renders when session is active
  - Contextual tooltip explains why disabled
- Enhanced `SystemMessage` with category-based styling:
  - Detects compaction/retry messages from content
  - Compaction messages: amber tint on text + dividers
  - Retry messages: orange tint on text + dividers
  - Default: neutral (unchanged)
- Added inline compaction indicator in `ChatView` — amber pulsing dot + "Compacting context…" text, same pattern as "Pi is thinking…" streaming indicator
- Added `CompactButton` to AppShell toolbar — positioned before NewSessionButton in the session management controls group

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1D.11 — Compaction controls (manual compact button, auto-compaction start/end indicators)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1D.12 — Extension UI dialogs (select list, confirm yes/no, text input, multi-line editor)
- Extension UI request events are already typed in contracts (`PiExtensionDialogRequest` union)
- `wireTransport.ts` has placeholder `extension_ui_request` case (currently no-op)
- Server handler `handleSessionExtensionUiResponse` exists in session.ts
- Need: Zustand slice for pending dialog state, dialog components (SelectDialog, ConfirmDialog, InputDialog, EditorDialog), wiring in wireTransport, response dispatch
- 9 items remaining in Phase 1D
