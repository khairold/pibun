## Session 0 — System Setup (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Explored all reference projects (khairold-com, quotecraft, three-anchors, caselaw, unifi-com-my, second-brain, webm-converter)
- Read all 8 systems articles (plan-protocol, agent-soul, work-on-the-system, autopilot, self-aware-agents, atomic-design, browser-tool, meta-tasks)
- Analyzed T3 Code and Electrobun reference repos
- Reviewed existing pibun documentation (6 doc files)
- Created full agent operating system:
  - `.plan/` — PLAN.md (8 phases, 100+ items), MEMORY.md (15 decisions), DRIFT.md, SESSION-LOG.md
  - `.pi/` — AGENTS.md (5 roles, gap detection, 4 playbooks), CAPABILITY-MAP.md
  - `.agents/` — SOUL.md, HUMAN.md, TENSIONS.md, CONVENTIONS.md
  - `CLAUDE.md` — session boot file

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.7 — Set up agent system

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Next:** Phase 0 items 0.8–0.18 — Initialize Bun monorepo scaffold
- Start with 0.8 (workspace root package.json)
- Need to verify `pi --mode rpc` works (0.18) — requires Pi installed locally with API keys
- All docs already written — the scaffold should follow ARCHITECTURE.md structure exactly
- Reference `reference/t3code/package.json` and `reference/t3code/turbo.json` for monorepo patterns

---

## Session 1 — Root Config Scaffolding (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created root `package.json` with Bun workspaces (`apps/*`, `packages/*`), scripts for build/dev/typecheck/lint/format
- Created `turbo.json` with build/dev/typecheck/clean tasks (lint runs via Biome at root, not via Turbo)
- Created `tsconfig.base.json` with strict TypeScript settings matching t3code patterns (ES2023, Bundler resolution, verbatimModuleSyntax, exactOptionalPropertyTypes)
- Created `biome.json` with tabs, double quotes, semicolons, recommended lint rules, noUnusedImports/noUnusedVariables warnings
- Installed deps: Turbo 2.8.20, Biome 1.9.4, TypeScript 5.9.3
- Fixed: Turbo 2.8+ requires `packageManager` field — added `"packageManager": "bun@1.2.21"`
- Fixed: Biome postinstall blocked — ran `bun pm trust @biomejs/biome`
- Formatted all files with Biome (spaces → tabs)
- Verified `bun run typecheck && bun run lint` passes

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.8 — Initialize Bun workspace root
- [x] 0.9 — Set up Turbo for build orchestration
- [x] 0.10 — Set up base TypeScript config
- [x] 0.11 — Set up Biome for lint + format

**Issues encountered:**
- Turbo 2.8+ requires `packageManager` in root package.json (not documented in t3code reference which uses an older Turbo)
- Biome postinstall needs explicit trust in Bun

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 0.12 — Create `packages/contracts/` scaffold
- Items 0.12–0.16 are package/app scaffolds (each small — could combine several)
- All config files use tabs (Biome formatter). Run `bun run format` after writing new files
- tsconfig.base.json does NOT include Bun types — server package must add `@types/bun` itself
- tsconfig.base.json does NOT include JSX config — web package must add `jsx: "react-jsx"` itself

---

## Session 2 — Package Scaffolds + RPC Verification (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created all 5 package/app scaffolds (0.12–0.16):
  - `packages/contracts/` — types-only package, empty `src/index.ts`
  - `packages/shared/` — runtime utils with subpath export `./jsonl`, depends on contracts
  - `apps/server/` — Bun server with `@types/bun`, depends on contracts + shared
  - `apps/web/` — React 19 + Vite 6 + Tailwind v4, with `@/` path alias, `index.html`, stub App component
  - `apps/desktop/` — Electrobun placeholder with `@types/bun`, depends on contracts
- Ran `bun install` — 90 packages installed, trusted `esbuild` postinstall
- Fixed Biome import ordering in `vite.config.ts` (`node:` builtins must come first)
- Verified `bun run typecheck` passes (all 5 packages)
- Verified `bun run lint` passes (22 files, no issues)
- Verified Pi RPC mode with Pi 0.61.1:
  - `get_available_models` returns 23 Anthropic models
  - `get_state` returns model info, session details, streaming status
  - Discovered: commands use `"type"` field (not `"command"`), Pi auto-creates sessions

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.12 — Create `packages/contracts/` scaffold
- [x] 0.13 — Create `packages/shared/` scaffold
- [x] 0.14 — Create `apps/server/` scaffold
- [x] 0.15 — Create `apps/web/` scaffold
- [x] 0.16 — Create `apps/desktop/` scaffold
- [x] 0.17 — Verify monorepo: `bun install` + `bun run typecheck` + `bun run lint` all pass
- [x] 0.18 — Verify Pi RPC works locally

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome organizeImports requires `node:` builtins before `@scoped` packages — fixed immediately
- esbuild (Vite dep) needs `bun pm trust` — already in trustedDependencies from Session 1

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Phase 0 is COMPLETE** — all exit criteria met
- Next: Phase 1A.1 — Define Pi RPC event types in `packages/contracts/`
- Read `reference/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/docs/rpc.md` for authoritative event type definitions
- Key: Pi RPC commands use `{"type": "command_name"}` format, responses use `{"type": "response", "command": "..."}`
- All source files are stubs — real implementation starts in Phase 1A

---

## Session 4 — JSONL Parser + Tests (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `JsonlParser` class in `packages/shared/src/jsonl.ts`:
  - Stateful buffer accumulation, strict LF-only splitting, optional `\r` stripping
  - `feed(chunk)` — processes data, emits complete lines via callback
  - `flush()` — emits any remaining buffered content (for stream end)
  - `reset()` — discards buffered content
  - `serializeJsonl(value)` — serializes a value as `JSON + \n` for writing to Pi stdin
  - Pattern follows Pi's own `attachJsonlLineReader` but is framework-agnostic (not tied to Node `Readable`)
- Wrote 34 unit tests in `packages/shared/src/jsonl.test.ts` covering:
  - Basic parsing (single line, multiple lines, valid JSON)
  - Partial lines (split across 2-3 chunks, many small chunks)
  - Unicode line separators (U+2028, U+2029 preserved inside JSON strings)
  - Empty lines (skipped between records, leading, trailing)
  - Rapid multi-line (100 lines in one chunk, interleaved boundaries)
  - CRLF handling (normalized, mixed, bare `\r` preserved)
  - Flush behavior (unterminated lines, empty buffer, post-complete)
  - Reset behavior (discards buffer)
  - Serialization (objects, primitives, round-trip, Unicode round-trip)
- Fixed TS strict mode + Biome lint conflict: `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` requires narrowing array access, but Biome forbids `!` assertions → created `lineAt()` safe accessor helper

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.4 — Implement JSONL parser in `packages/shared/`
- [x] 1A.5 — Write unit tests for JSONL parser

**Issues encountered:**
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + Biome `noNonNullAssertion` tension in tests — resolved with `lineAt()` helper

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.6 — Implement `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/`
- `PiProcess` wraps `Bun.spawn()` of `pi --mode rpc`, uses `JsonlParser` for stdout, handles lifecycle
- Then 1A.7 (PiRpcManager), 1A.8 (crash handling), 1A.9 (tests), 1A.10 (manual integration test)
- Use `@pibun/shared/jsonl` import path for the parser
- Bun's `Bun.spawn()` provides stdout as `ReadableStream` — need to pipe chunks through `JsonlParser.feed()`

---

## Session 5 — PiProcess Class (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/src/piProcess.ts` — the core subprocess wrapper for Pi RPC:
  - **Spawn**: Uses `Bun.spawn()` with all stdio piped. Builds CLI args from options (provider, model, thinking, session, etc.)
  - **Stdout reading**: Background async loop reads `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`, feeds chunks through `JsonlParser` from `@pibun/shared/jsonl`
  - **JSONL dispatch**: Parsed lines are dispatched — `type === "response"` goes to response listeners + pending request correlation; other types go to event listeners
  - **Command correlation**: `sendCommand()` auto-generates IDs, writes JSONL to stdin, returns `Promise<PiResponse>` with 30s timeout
  - **Extension UI**: `sendExtensionResponse()` writes fire-and-forget to stdin (uses original request ID)
  - **Stderr capture**: Background reader accumulates all stderr in buffer, notifies listeners
  - **Process lifecycle**: States: idle → running → stopped/crashed. `start()` spawns, `stop()` sends SIGTERM → 3s timeout → SIGKILL
  - **Crash detection**: If process exits while in "running" state, marks as "crashed" and rejects all pending requests
  - **Typed subprocess**: Uses `Subprocess<"pipe","pipe","pipe">` which gives `FileSink` stdin and `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>` stdout/stderr
  - **5 listener types**: `onEvent`, `onResponse`, `onExit`, `onError`, `onStderr` — all return unsubscribe functions
- Fixed server tsconfig: removed `composite`, `declaration`, `declarationMap`, and `references` — workspace packages export `.ts` directly via package.json `exports`, so project references are unnecessary and caused TS6305 errors
- Fixed `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` issue with `Bun.spawn` cwd/env: always provide values (cwd defaults to `process.cwd()`, env always passes `process.env`)
- Fixed Biome import ordering: `@pibun/*` before `bun` (bare specifiers)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.6 — Implement `PiProcess` class in `apps/server/`

**Issues encountered:**
- TS6305 errors from project references expecting `.d.ts` files that don't exist — resolved by removing project references from server tsconfig
- Bun's `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` rejects `cwd: undefined` — resolved by always providing a value
- Biome import ordering: `bun` (bare specifier) sorts after `@pibun/*` (scoped packages)

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.7 — Implement `PiRpcManager` in `apps/server/`
- PiRpcManager maps session ID → PiProcess instance. Methods: `createSession()` → spawn PiProcess, `getSession()`, `stopSession()` → kill process, `stopAll()`
- Then: 1A.8 (crash/exit handling with cleanup), 1A.9 (unit tests with mock subprocess), 1A.10 (manual integration test)
- Key: PiProcess is fully functional but not yet tested. PiRpcManager is the next layer.
- Other app tsconfigs (desktop, web) may also need project references removed when they start importing workspace packages.

## Session 3 — Pi RPC Contract Types (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Defined complete Pi RPC type system in `packages/contracts/` across 4 files:
  - `piTypes.ts` — Base types: content blocks (text, thinking, image, toolCall), messages (user, assistant, toolResult, bashExecution), model, usage, session state, compaction/bash/session stats results, slash commands, thinking levels, stop reasons
  - `piEvents.ts` — 16 event types: agent lifecycle, turn lifecycle, message lifecycle, tool execution, auto-compaction, auto-retry, extension error, extension UI requests (9 methods: select, confirm, input, editor, notify, setStatus, setWidget, setTitle, set_editor_text)
  - `piCommands.ts` — 24 command types: prompting, state, model, thinking, queue modes, compaction, retry, bash, session management, slash commands. Plus 3 extension UI response types (value, confirm, cancel)
  - `piResponses.ts` — Per-command success responses + generic error response. `PiStdoutLine` union covers all possible JSONL from Pi stdout
  - `index.ts` — Re-exports all types (~80 type exports)
- All types are pure TypeScript interfaces/types — zero runtime code (Decision 12)
- Types modeled from authoritative Pi source (`reference/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/rpc/rpc-types.ts` and `rpc.md`)
- Verified: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes, types importable from `@pibun/contracts`

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.1 — Define Pi RPC event types in `packages/contracts/`
- [x] 1A.2 — Define Pi RPC command types in `packages/contracts/`
- [x] 1A.3 — Define Pi RPC response type in `packages/contracts/`

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.4 — Implement JSONL parser in `packages/shared/`
- The parser must split on `\n` only — see CONVENTIONS.md for the exact pattern
- `packages/shared/src/jsonl.ts` already exists as a stub with the correct export path (`@pibun/shared/jsonl`)
- After JSONL parser: 1A.5 (unit tests), then 1A.6 (PiProcess class in server)

---

## Session 7 — PiRpcManager Unit Tests (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created fake Pi binary at `apps/server/test-fixtures/fake-pi.ts`:
  - Executable Bun script with shebang, accepts same CLI args as `pi --mode rpc`
  - Reads JSONL from stdin, responds with success JSONL on stdout
  - Configurable via env vars: `FAKE_PI_CRASH_AFTER_MS`, `FAKE_PI_EXIT_CODE`, `FAKE_PI_STDERR`
- Wrote 37 unit tests in `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.test.ts` across 6 categories:
  - **Session creation** (6 tests): auto-generated IDs, custom IDs, duplicate rejection, process state, created event
  - **Session lookup** (7 tests): getSession, hasSession, size, getActiveSessions, getAllSessions
  - **Session stopping** (8 tests): stopSession removes/emits, no-op for unknown, safe double-stop, stopAll parallel, stopAll events
  - **Crash handling** (5 tests): crash detection with event, session removal on crash, stderr capture, crash isolation (other sessions unaffected), process state after crash
  - **Event listeners** (4 tests): event ordering (created→crashed), multiple listeners, unsubscribe, session ID delivery
  - **Command forwarding** (3 tests): send command through session, ID correlation, parallel commands to different sessions
  - **Edge cases** (4 tests): default options, size lifecycle, getSession after stop, hasSession after crash
- Fixed Biome lint issues: `process.env["KEY"]` → `process.env.KEY` (useLiteralKeys), `type` imports sorted before value imports, formatting

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.9 — Write unit tests for PiRpcManager (mock subprocess, verify event routing)

**Issues encountered:**
- Biome `useLiteralKeys` rule prefers `process.env.KEY` over bracket notation
- Biome sorts `type` imports before value imports within the same import statement

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.10 — Manual integration test: spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events
- This is the LAST item in Phase 1A — completing it means verifying exit criteria and marking phase complete
- The test should create a script that uses PiRpcManager to spawn a real Pi process, send "hello", and log all streaming events
- Requires `pi` installed locally with API keys (verified in Session 2 with Pi 0.61.1)
- After 1A.10, Phase 1A is complete → move to Phase 1B (WebSocket Bridge)

---

## Session 8 — Integration Test + Phase 1A Complete (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Created integration test script at `apps/server/src/integration-test.ts`:
  - Spawns a real Pi RPC process via PiRpcManager (anthropic/sonnet/low thinking, ephemeral mode)
  - Sends `get_state` command first (no API cost) to verify connectivity
  - Sends a minimal prompt ("Respond with exactly one word: hello") to test streaming
  - Logs all events, responses, stderr, and errors with timestamps
  - Waits for `agent_end` event, then cleanly stops all sessions
- Ran the test successfully against Pi 0.61.1:
  - `get_state` returned model info (claude-sonnet-4-6, thinking=low)
  - Prompt produced full streaming event lifecycle: agent_start → turn_start → message_start (user) → message_end (user) → message_start (assistant) → message_update (text_start, text_delta: "hello", text_end) → message_end (assistant) → turn_end → agent_end
  - Session stopped cleanly with no errors
  - Total cost: ~$0.015 (mostly cache write tokens)
- Fixed two type errors: `PiPromptCommand.message` is `string` (not content blocks), `PiResponse.data` requires narrowing via `command` field
- **Phase 1A exit criteria verified**: test script spawns Pi via RPC, sends "hello", logs all streaming events, process cleanup works on exit

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.10 — Manual integration test: spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events

**Issues encountered:**
- `PiPromptCommand.message` type is `string`, not `PiTextContent[]` — fixed immediately
- `PiResponse` discriminated union requires narrowing via `command` field before accessing `data` — fixed by adding `stateResp.command === "get_state"` check

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Phase 1A is COMPLETE** — all 10 items done, exit criteria met
- Next: Phase 1B.1 — Define WebSocket protocol types in `packages/contracts/`
- Read `docs/WS_PROTOCOL.md` for the WebSocket message contract
- Key types needed: WsRequest (method + params + id), WsResponse (result/error + id), WsPush (channel + data), method strings
- The server needs HTTP + WebSocket setup (Bun.serve with websocket handler)
- Reference `reference/t3code/packages/contracts/src/ws.ts` for patterns (but use our simpler method string approach)

---

## Session 6 — PiRpcManager + Crash Handling (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Implemented `PiRpcManager` class in `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.ts`:
  - **Session mapping**: `Map<string, ManagedSession>` with auto-generated IDs (`session_{counter}_{timestamp}`)
  - **createSession()**: Accepts `CreateSessionOptions` (extends `PiProcessOptions` with optional custom `sessionId`), spawns PiProcess, wires crash listeners, emits "created" event
  - **getSession()**: Lookup by ID, returns `ManagedSession | undefined`
  - **getActiveSessions()**: Filters to only "running" state processes
  - **getAllSessions()**: Returns all sessions regardless of state
  - **stopSession()**: Removes from map FIRST (prevents re-entrant cleanup), then stops process, emits "stopped" event
  - **stopAll()**: Parallel `Promise.all` stop of all sessions — used for server shutdown
  - **Crash handling** (1A.8): `attachProcessListeners()` wires `onExit` + `onError` to each PiProcess. On unexpected exit (state === "crashed"), captures stderr, removes session, emits `{ type: "crashed", exitCode, stderr }`. Non-fatal errors (parse failures) don't remove the session.
  - **Session events**: `onSessionEvent()` listener with unsubscribe. Events: created, stopped, crashed.
  - **Cleanup**: `removeSession()` deletes from sessions map AND unsubscribes all PiProcess listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Fixed unused import warning (`PiProcessState` not needed in manager)
- Verified: `bun run typecheck` passes, `bun run lint` passes (0 warnings)

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1A.7 — Implement `PiRpcManager` in `apps/server/`
- [x] 1A.8 — Handle Pi process crash/exit (emit error event, clean up session, log stderr)

**Issues encountered:**
- None

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1A.9 — Write unit tests for PiRpcManager (mock subprocess, verify event routing)
- Then: 1A.10 — Manual integration test (spawn Pi, send prompt, log streaming events)
- PiRpcManager is at `apps/server/src/piRpcManager.ts`. It depends on `PiProcess` from `./piProcess.js`
- Key test scenarios: create/get/stop session, duplicate ID rejection, crash detection with stderr capture, stopAll parallel, listener cleanup on session removal
- For mocking: PiProcess spawns `Bun.spawn()` — tests will need to either mock the subprocess or use a fake Pi binary (a script that echoes JSONL)
