## Session 0 — Planning (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Audited session creation bug: events silently dropped due to session ID domain mismatch
- Fixed root cause: introduced `piSessionId` field to separate Pi UUID from PiBun manager ID (commit `059d862`)
- Fixed `ensureSession` to pass active tab CWD for project-scoped sessions
- Removed dead `NewSessionButton.tsx`
- Discussed UX issues: two active sessions, bad default names, orphan empty sessions
- Decided to simplify from multi-tab to single-active-session model
- Created phased plan (3 phases, ~21 items)

**Items completed:**
- [x] Root cause fix for event routing
- [x] Plan created

**Handoff to next session:**
- Start with Phase 1 — single-session enforcement
- Key risk: `session.switchSession` (Pi in-process command) vs stop/start (new process). Need to decide which approach for resuming past sessions. See Parking Lot.
- The `defaultTabName()` change to empty string was made but not committed — Phase 2.2 will finish it.

---

## Session 1 — Phase 1.1: createNewTab → startSession (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Renamed `createNewTab` to `startSession` in `tabActions.ts`
- Removed `keepExisting` param from `WsSessionStartParams` in contracts
- Simplified server's `handleSessionStart` to always stop existing session (no `keepExisting` check)
- Updated all 5 callers: `Sidebar.tsx`, `TabBar.tsx`, `wireTransport.ts`, `useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`, `appActions.ts`
- Updated `multi-session-test.ts` to remove `keepExisting` references

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1.1 — `createNewTab` → `startSession`

**Issues encountered:**
- None. Clean rename with no type errors.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1.2 — Remove background event routing in `wireTransport.ts`
- The `bgTab` branch in the `pi.event` handler routes events to background tabs — this needs to go since only one session is active.

---

## Session 2 — Phase 1.2: Remove background event routing (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Removed the entire `else` branch in the `pi.event` subscriber in `wireTransport.ts`
- This branch handled background tab event routing: `hasUnread`, `setBackgroundTabStatus`, `setBackgroundTabWidget`, background tab status updates (`agent_start`, `agent_end`, `extension_ui_request`, `auto_retry_end`)
- Replaced with a simple guard: if `data.sessionId` doesn't match the active session, skip with `console.debug` log
- All events now go to `handlePiEvent` → single session = always active
- ~50 lines of background tab routing code removed, replaced with ~6 lines of stale event guard

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1.2 — Remove background event routing in `wireTransport.ts`

**Issues encountered:**
- None. Clean removal — no type errors, no broken references. The methods called in the removed branch (`setBackgroundTabStatus`, `setBackgroundTabWidget`, `hasUnread`) still exist in the store but are now dead code — slated for removal in items 1.6 and 3.1/3.3.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1.3 — Remove `tabMessages`, `tabStatuses`, `tabWidgets` caches from `workspaceSlice`
- These caches saved/restored messages when switching tabs (multi-session). In single-session model, messages live in the store directly and are loaded from Pi via `session.getMessages` on switch.
- Read `workspaceSlice.ts` carefully — the save/restore logic is in `switchTab`.

---

## Session 3 — Phase 1.3: Remove per-tab message/status/widget caches (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Removed `tabMessages`, `tabStatuses`, `tabWidgets` state fields from `TabsSlice` type and `workspaceSlice` implementation
- Removed `saveActiveTabMessages` method (type + implementation)
- Simplified `switchTab`: no longer saves current tab's messages/statuses/widgets to cache or restores from cache. Instead clears messages and relies on async action layer (`switchTabAction` → `loadSessionMessages`) to load from Pi
- Simplified `removeTab`: no longer manipulates cache Maps or restores cached messages for the next tab. Clears messages; async layer loads if needed
- Made `setBackgroundTabStatus`/`setBackgroundTabWidget` into no-ops (their backing state is gone, but the type interface stays until 1.6 removes them)
- Updated `tabActions.ts`: removed `nextTabHasCache` check in `closeTab`, removed `hasCachedMessages` check in `switchTabAction`. Both now always load from Pi

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1.3 — Remove `tabMessages`, `tabStatuses`, `tabWidgets` caches from `workspaceSlice`

**Issues encountered:**
- `setBackgroundTabStatus`/`setBackgroundTabWidget` implementations referenced the removed `tabStatuses`/`tabWidgets` state — had to make them no-ops to keep the build passing. These are dead code anyway (nothing calls them after 1.2 removed background routing) and are slated for full removal in 1.6.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1.4 — Simplify `switchTab` in workspaceSlice: no message save/restore. Just update `activeTabId`, set session metadata.
- Note: 1.4 is largely done — `switchTab` already doesn't save/restore messages after this session's changes. May be a quick verification/no-op or can combine with 1.5.
- `switchTab` still snapshots the leaving tab's metadata (streaming, messageCount, model, etc.) which is still useful for sidebar display. That stays.

---

## Session 4 — Phase 1.4+1.5: switchTab verification + switchTabAction simplification (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Verified `switchTab` (1.4): already matches plan — no message save/restore, just metadata snapshot + clear + set target. Checked off.
- Added `sessionFile: string | null` to `SessionTab` type in contracts — tabs now track their Pi session file path for resume.
- Updated `workspaceSlice.ts`: `addTab` initializes `sessionFile: null`, `switchTab` snapshots `sessionFile` from store to leaving tab and restores from target tab, `syncActiveTabState` saves `sessionFile`, `removeTab` restores `sessionFile` from next tab.
- Simplified `switchTabAction` (1.5): replaces multi-session transport routing with single-session resume flow. If target has `sessionFile`, clears `store.sessionId` and calls `switchSession()` from sessionActions which handles the full lifecycle (start process → switch to session file → load messages → refresh state). If no session, routes transport to null.
- Removed unused imports (`loadSessionMessages`, `refreshSessionState`) from tabActions since `switchSession` handles those internally.

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1.4 — Simplify `switchTab` in workspaceSlice (verified — already done in 1.3)
- [x] 1.5 — Simplify `switchTabAction` in tabActions

**Issues encountered:**
- None. Clean implementation — the existing `switchSession()` and `ensureSession()` functions in sessionActions already handle all the heavy lifting when `sessionId` is cleared first. No new server changes needed.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: 1.6 — Remove `reorderTabs`, `setBackgroundTabStatus`, `setBackgroundTabWidget`, `tabTerminalActiveIds` — all multi-session-only features.
- `setBackgroundTabStatus`/`setBackgroundTabWidget` are already no-ops (backing state removed in 1.3). Just need to remove from type interface and implementation.
- `reorderTabs` is dead code — no tab bar with drag-to-reorder in single-session sidebar model.
- `tabTerminalActiveIds` is still used for saving/restoring per-tab terminal state. Consider whether this is still needed or if terminals should be project-scoped (per DRIFT.md decision #1).
- `closeTab` still has stale-session bugs — slated for Phase 3.6, not 1.6.

---

## Session 5 — Phase 1.6+1.7: Remove multi-session-only features + verify (2026-03-24)

**What happened:**
- Removed `tabTerminalActiveIds` Map from TabsSlice type and workspaceSlice state
- Updated `switchTab` and `removeTab` to use `terminalTabs.find(t => t.ownerTabId === tabId)` instead of the cache
- Removed `reorderTabs` method (type + implementation) — only consumer was dead `TabBar` component
- Removed `setBackgroundTabStatus` and `setBackgroundTabWidget` (type + implementation) — were already no-ops since 1.3
- Cleaned up `TabBar.tsx`: removed drag-to-reorder handlers, drag props from TabItemProps, unused imports (`DragEvent`, `useState`)
- Ran full verification: `bun run typecheck && bun run build && bun run format` — all pass
- **Phase 1 complete** — all 7 items checked off, exit criteria met

**Items completed:**
- [x] 1.6 — Remove `reorderTabs`, `setBackgroundTabStatus`, `setBackgroundTabWidget`, `tabTerminalActiveIds`
- [x] 1.7 — Verify: `bun run typecheck && bun run build`

**Phase 1 exit criteria verification:**
- ✅ Only one Pi process runs (enforced by `startSession` — 1.1)
- ✅ Switching sessions stops the old one (`switchTabAction` — 1.5)
- ✅ No background event routing (removed in 1.2)
- ✅ No per-tab message/status/widget caches (removed in 1.3)
- ✅ No multi-session-only features (removed in 1.6)
- ✅ All type checks pass, build succeeds

**Issues encountered:**
- `TabBar.tsx` still referenced `reorderTabs` despite being dead code (not imported anywhere). Fixed by stripping drag-to-reorder from TabBar.

**Handoff to next session:**
- Next: Phase 2 — Session Lifecycle UX
- Start with 2.1 — Auto-remove empty sessions on switch
- `TabBar` is dead code — not imported anywhere. Full removal deferred to Phase 3.
- Terminal active ID selection now uses first-match instead of cached value — acceptable since terminals are going project-scoped post-Phase 3.
