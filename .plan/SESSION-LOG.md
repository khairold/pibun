## Session 0 — System Setup (2026-03-23)

**What happened:**
- Explored all reference projects (khairold-com, quotecraft, three-anchors, caselaw, unifi-com-my, second-brain, webm-converter)
- Read all 8 systems articles (plan-protocol, agent-soul, work-on-the-system, autopilot, self-aware-agents, atomic-design, browser-tool, meta-tasks)
- Analyzed T3 Code and Electrobun reference repos
- Reviewed existing pibun documentation (6 doc files)
- Created full agent operating system:
  - `.plan/` — PLAN.md (8 phases, 100+ items), MEMORY.md (15 decisions), DRIFT.md, SESSION-LOG.md
  - `.pi/` — AGENTS.md (5 roles, gap detection, 4 playbooks), CAPABILITY-MAP.md
  - `.agents/` — SOUL.md, HUMAN.md, TENSIONS.md, CONVENTIONS.md
  - `CLAUDE.md` — session boot file

**Items completed:**
- [x] 0.7 — Set up agent system

**Handoff to next session:**
- **Next:** Phase 0 items 0.8–0.18 — Initialize Bun monorepo scaffold
- Start with 0.8 (workspace root package.json)
- Need to verify `pi --mode rpc` works (0.18) — requires Pi installed locally with API keys
- All docs already written — the scaffold should follow ARCHITECTURE.md structure exactly
- Reference `reference/t3code/package.json` and `reference/t3code/turbo.json` for monorepo patterns
